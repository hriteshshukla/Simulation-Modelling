**Operational Efficiency Simulation – Kent Diabetes Centre** 

**Toolset: SIMUL8, Excel, Statistical Distributions, Sensitivity Analysis** 

**Project Type: Individual Academic Project (University of Kent – MSc Business Analytics)**

Modelled and analysed patient workflows at Kent Diabetes Centre using discrete-event simulation to identify operational inefficiencies and cost bottlenecks. Built a detailed SIMUL8 model incorporating real-world constraints (arrival rates, consultation stages, and resource allocation) and tested multiple configurations.

Key outcomes:

- Achieved a 31% cost reduction by optimising shift patterns and treatment sequencing, lowering daily costs from over £5,000 to £3,322.

- Identified peak-time bottlenecks in reception and diagnostics; proposed automated check-ins and triage priority logic.

- Enhanced resource utilisation across consultants, nurses, and administrators by balancing workload through scheduling algorithms.

- Conducted sensitivity analysis on distributions to validate model robustness and guide data-driven improvements in patient throughput.

- This project demonstrated the power of simulation in healthcare systems to balance quality of care, operational flow, and cost-efficiency.
